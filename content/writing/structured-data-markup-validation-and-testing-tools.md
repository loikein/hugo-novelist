---

Schema.org structured data helps you to highlight specific information for
search engines and to improve the way your page displays in SERPs. I have
compiled a list of tools you might find helpful for testing structured data
markup and rich snippet display (microdata, RDFa, RDFa Lite and JSON-LD).

* [Google Structured Data Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/) — The
Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT) provides a variety of ways to develop, test,
and modify your structured markup. You can load markup into the tool either
directly or by supplying a URL.
* [Yandex Structured data validator](https://webmaster.yandex.com/tools/microtest/) — The validator lets
you check all the most common microformats: microdata, schema.org, microformats,
OpenGraph and RDF. However, not all formats support special snippets or the use
of annotated data.
* [Bing Markup Validator](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/markup-validator) — Try
Markup Validator and validate the markup you have added to your web pages
including HTML Microdata, Microformats, RDFa, Schema.org.
* [JSON-LD Playground](http://json-ld.org/playground/) — Play around with JSON-LD
markup by typing out some JSON below and seeing what gets generated from it at
the bottom of the page. Pick any of the examples below to get started. The
playground uses the jsonld.js JSON-LD processor which fully conforms to the
JSON-LD Syntax and API specifications.
* [RD](http://rdfa.info/play/)[Fa Pl](http://rdfa.info/play/)[ay
](http://rdfa.info/play/)— Paste your HTML+RDFa code and preview data
visualization. You can also see the raw data by clicking on the “Raw Data” tab.
* [Facebook Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) — You can use
the Sharing Debugger to see the information that is used when your website
content is shared on Facebook, Messenger and other places. The Batch Invalidator
will let you refresh this information for multiple URLs at the same time. Open
Graph markup lets you take control over how your website content appears to
others.

allows for conversions triggered either by URI or by direct text input.
Furthermore it comes with a straightforward REST API for developers.

Data Linter is a tool aiding webmasters and web developers to verify the
structured data present in their HTML pages. Search engines use structured data
to understand webpages more accurately and to present enhanced search results.
The Linter understands the microdata, JSON-LD and RDFa formats according to
their latest specifications.
