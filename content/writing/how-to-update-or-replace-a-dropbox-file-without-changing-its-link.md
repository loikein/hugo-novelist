title: How to update or replace a Dropbox file without changing its link
---
Dropbox is a modern workspace designed to reduce busywork-so you can focus on the things that matter. It is also one of the best and most popular file syncing services out there, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

To avoid this issue, you need to replace the file without deleting. That means rename the updated file with the same name as the current file that is already uploaded to Dropbox. You need to change the name before uploading to Dropbox.

* The first thing you need to do is to open Dropbox in your internet browser and open the folder that contains the file that you need replaced.
* On your computer, navigate to the folder that contains the new and updated version of your file.
* Dropbox will automatically replace the original file with the new file without any warning dialog box popping up. For this reason, itâ€™s really important to be sure that you are updating the correct file otherwise you might lose a file you meant to keep.
* If you need to keep the old file, it is recommended to download it before replacing it with the new file. The extension of the new file should be same as the existing file.
