title: Text-only websites

Today's websites have become bloated and slow. Text-only websites are incredibly useful when networks are slower and bandwidth is at a premium. They load much faster, donâ€™t contain any pop-ups or ads or autoplay videos, and help people with low bandwidth or limited Internet access.
