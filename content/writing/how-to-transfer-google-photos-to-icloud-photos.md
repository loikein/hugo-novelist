title: How to transfer Google Photos to iCloud Photos
---

Google plans to start limiting their previously unlimited storage in Google Photos. Company announced last fall that the free unlimited storage is ending on June 1. If you're running out of storage on Google Photos and own an Apple device, you might want to consider transferring your photos to iCloud. In this post, I will tell you how to transfer photos to iCloud from Google Photos, and whether you should do it.

Before you begin moving photos, you might want to check for and remove unwanted screenshots, wallpapers, and other images from Google Photos. Open Google Photos in a web browser on your PC or Mac to delete those unwanted photos.

## Export from Google photos

- Open [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) in a web browser.
- Log in to your Google account.
- To just export photos/videos click “Deselect all” on the right-hand side.
- Download a full copy of your Google Photos library.
- Scroll to the bottom and hit “Next” to continue.
- When done, select the “Create Export” button.
- Google will email you the link once the download is ready. It will split the files into batches of 2Gb packages if the photo volume is high.

## Import to iCloud Photos

- Open [icloud.com](icloud.com) on the web browser of your PC or Mac and go to iCloud Photos.
- Select the upload icon to import the previously downloaded photos.
