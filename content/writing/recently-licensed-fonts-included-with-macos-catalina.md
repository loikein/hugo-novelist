Apple has recently licensed fonts from Commercial Type and Klim Type Foundry for use in macOS Catalina. That means Mac users can now freely download and install some of the most popular fonts on web. But since these fonts are an optional download, many users of Mac are not even aware they have access to them for free. To see and install these optional fonts, open the FontBook application and switch to “All Fonts”.
