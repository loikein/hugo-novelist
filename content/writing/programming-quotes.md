Here are some amazing quotes about programming and software development to inspire you, make you laugh, or make you think.

> If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
> 
> *Edsger Dijkstra* 

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
> 
> *Linus Torvalds*

> Java is to JavaScript what Car is to Carpet.
> 
> *Chris Heilmann*

> Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
> 
> *Brian Kernighan*

> If you optimize everything, you will always be unhappy.
> 
> *Donald Knuth*

> It's not a bug; it's an undocumented feature.
> 
> *Anonymous*

> Programming in different languages is like composing pieces in different keys, particularly if you work at the keyboard. If you have learned or written pieces in many keys, each key will have its own special emotional aura.
> 
> *Douglas Hofstadter*

> End-to-End encryption is practically a meaningless phrase used by internet-based companies to coax people into believing the modern myth of online privacy.
> 
> *Abhijit Naskar*

> What I love about both programming and music is that they enable you to build incredibly creative, complex, and beneficial things seemingly from thin air no additional materials required, just your brain and a keyboard in front of you.
Programming and music also both allow for a deep, single-minded immersion in the creative process. They require you to be deeply focused and in the moment for everything to work well, and I find that state of flow to be immensely satisfying.

> *Peter Borum*


> Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork.
> 
> *Sam Ewing*

> That’s what’s cool about working with computers.  They don’t argue, they remember everything, and they don’t drink all your beer.

> 
> *Dennie van Tassel*

> 
> *Jeremy S. Anderson*

> Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
> 
> *Larry Wall*

> The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late.
> 
> *Seymour Cray*

> Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
> 
> *Bill Gates*

> First learn computer science and all the theory.  Next develop a programming style.  Then forget all that and just hack.
> 
> *George Carrette*

>There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.
> 
> *Bjarne Stroustrup*

> PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.
>
