A good choice of font for your coding can make a huge difference and improve
your productivity, so take a look at the fonts in this post that can make your
text editor or terminal emulator look little bit nicer.

1. [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/) — designed by professionals to improve developers’ productivity. MonoLisa features a few unique techniques that increase the legibility and make it visually pleasant to look at for longer periods of time.

1.  [Andale® Mono](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/andale-mono/) — is a monospaced
sans-serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson for terminal emulation and
software development environments, originally for the Taligent project by Apple
Inc. and IBM. The Andalé design was originally created by Monotype, as part of
Andalé font families.
1.  [Aperçu](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/apercu/) — Aperçu was started
in December 2009, and has been trialled and tested through a number of design
comissions taken on by The Entente through 2010. The conceit behind Aperçu was
to create a synopsis or amalgamation of classic realist typefaces: Johnston,
Gill Sans, Neuzeit & Franklin Gothic.
1.  [Courier Std](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/courier-std) — is a
typewriter and slab serif font family. This typeface has four styles and was
published by Adobe. Courier Std has good Latin language support.
1.  [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) — It is a monospace
font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many
“programmer fonts,” designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases
do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.
1.  [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) — Designed to integrate
with the character of the FirefoxOS, the Fira typefaces also aim to cover the
legibility needs for a large range of handsets varying in screen quality and
rendering.
1.  [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/) — Source Code
was designed by Paul D. Hunt as a companion to Source Sans. This complementary
family was adapted from the Source design due to a request to create a
monospaced version for coding applications. Source Code preserves the design
features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but alters the glyph widths so
that they are uniform across all glyphs and weights.
1.  [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine) — Cousine was designed by
Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif design that is metrically
compatible with Courier New™. Cousine offers improved on-screen readability
characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of
developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability
across platforms.
1.  [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) —
Anonymous Pro (2009) is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed with coding
in mind. Anonymous Pro features an international, Unicode-based character set,
with support for most Western and Central European Latin-based languages, plus
Greek and Cyrillic. Anonymous Pro is based on an earlier font, Anonymous™
(2001), my TrueType version of Anonymous 9, a Macintosh bitmap font developed in
the mid-’90s by Susan Lesch and David Lamkins. Anonymous Pro is distributed with
the Open Font License (OFL).
1.  [Droid Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono) — Droid
Sans Mono is a fixed width version of Droid Sans. The Droid Sans Mono typefaces
were designed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corp. The Droid Sans Mono fonts
feature non-proportional spacing for displaying text in a tabular setting and
other uses where a monospaced font is desired. Droid Sans Mono has excellent
legibility characteristics in its letterforms.
1.  [Oxygen Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen+Mono) — Oxygen Mono is
the monospace companion family to Oxygen, the KDE project UI and brand type.
1.  [Cutive Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cutive+Mono) — The design of
Cutive, and this monospace sister family Cutive Mono, is based on a number of
classic typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM’s ‘Executive,’ and
the older ‘Smith-Premier.’ In Cutive these old faces re-emerge as webfonts that
are useful for adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for
headers and display.
1.  [Lekton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lekton) — Lekton has been designed at
ISIA Urbino, Italy, and is inspired by some of the typefaces used on the
Olivetti typewriters.
1.  [PT Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono) — PT Mono was developed for
specific uses in forms, tables, worksheets and other contexts. Equal character
widths are very helpful in setting complex documents, as with such a font you
may easily calculate size of entry fields, column widths in tables and so on.
One of the most important areas of use is in governmental web sites where
visitors have to fill different forms. Currently PT Mono consists of just one
Regular style.
1.  [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack) — Hack is designed to be a
workhorse typeface for code. It has deep roots in the libre, open source
typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera &
DejaVu projects.
1.  [Ubuntu Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) — The Ubuntu Font
Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts in development during
2010–2011. The development is being funded by Canonical Ltd on behalf the wider
Free Software community and the Ubuntu project. The technical font design work
and implementation is being undertaken by Dalton Maag.
1.  [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) — Space Mono is an
original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design.
It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and
other Western European languages.
1.  [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) — Roboto Mono is a
monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like the other members of the
Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide
variety of devices and reading environments. While the monospaced version is
related to its variable width cousin, it doesn’t hesitate to change forms to
better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment.
1.  [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) — A typeface
rooted in the traditions of typewriting, Operator is designed to offer a new
voice for designers, and a new tool for developers.
1.  [Input ](http://input.fontbureau.com/)— Input takes its aesthetic cues from
monospaced fonts and pixel fonts designed for consoles and screens, but casts
off the technical limitations that constrained them. Inspired by Matthew
Carter’s process for creating Verdana, David Jonathan Ross began designing Input
as a bitmap font.
1.  [Consolas](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=300) —
Consolas is aimed for use in programming environments and other circumstances
where a monospaced font is specified. All characters have the same width, like
old typewriters, making it a good choice for personal and business
correspondance. The improved Windows font display allowed a design with
proportions closer to normal text than traditional monospaced fonts like
Courier.
1.  [Liberation Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/liberation-mono) —
Developed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corporation as Ascender Sans and
Ascender Serif. A variant of this font family, with the addition of a monospaced
font and open-source license, was licensed by Red Hat, Inc. as the Liberation
font family.
1.  [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) — Monospaced font with
programming ligatures.
1.  [Monaco](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/monaco/) — Monaco is a monospaced
sans-serif typeface designed by Susan Kare and Kris Holmes. It ships with OS X
and was already present with all previous versions of the Mac operating system.
1.  [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro) — Office Code Pro
is a customized version of Source Code Pro, the monospaced sans serif originally
created by Paul D. Hunt for Adobe Systems Incorporated. The customizations were
made specifically for text editors and coding environments, but are still very
usable in other applications.
1.  [PragmataPro](http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) — PragmataPro™ is a
condensed monospaced font optimized for screen, designed to be the ideal font
for coding, math and engineering.
1.  [Cartograph CF](http://connary.com/cartograph.html) — Pairing the efficiency of
a monospaced font with warmth and character, Cartograph CF is a handsome font
family featuring both fixed-pitch and proportional sans versions. A tribute to
the utilitarian beauty of terminals and typewriters, Cartograph excels in any
setting.
